To work this program, you need at least Java version 9.0.4. 
This program uses the JavaFX libray

A simple explanation of how the program works: 

This is a simple restaurant menu order screen. 

Steps to navigate the application:

Home page:
First you will be presented with Home page. Simply click start to begin.

Main server home screen:
Next, you will be presented with the servers home screen. This screen will allow you to clock in, clock out, and view employees that have clocked in.
You will also be able to click on any table. To be able to create and input an order, you will first need to clock in with an ID.
ID can only be an integer value. Once clocked in, click on a table and input the number of guests the table will have.
After this you will be presented with the main order screen.

The order screen:
There are 3 tabs consiting of entrees, drinks or sides. Clicking each one will present you with items from each category. 
When presented with these screens, choose the item you wish to add by simply clicking it and hitting yes or no when prompted, and hit submit.
When submitted, you will be brought back to the order screen and see an updated list of items added to the tables order. 
NOTE: clicking on a menu item (when added to the order list) will prompt you to add a optional note. 
If you wish to create a note, click the item you wish to add a note to, write a note, and click overwrite.
There are other options like close check, which simply closes the check, in real life this is when you would be prompted to input the customers paymnet information.
Another option is remove items. Click the remove item button if you wish to remove any items from the order list. 
Once in the remove item menu, click the item and confirm with either yes or no.
The send order button in the order screen will simply display a message that the order has been sent to the kitchen.
There is also a total button that always displays the total of the order.

Most features are self explanatory and simple. We had very limited time to create this program as we first attempted to create the 
tic tac toe game with minimax algorithm but failed. So the design of this program is very simplistic.
